A simple implementation of sparse grid polynomial interpolation and corresponding interpolation.
It can be added to your environment through
```
] add https://github.com/benmkent/SparseGridsKit.jl
```

The construction is based upon the sparse operators introduced by Smolyak [Smolyak1963](@cite).
Key papers defining the model formulation include [Barthelmann2000](@cite), [Gerstner1998](@cite) and [Gerstner2003](@cite).
This construction of the approximation is inspired by the [Sparse Grids MATLAB Kit](https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-grids-kit) [Piazzola2024](@cite).

The package is still under development and by no means complete.
Issues, forks and pull requests are welcome!

# Example
In the simplest case one often wants to create a sparse grid using a sequence of nested sets Clenshaw--Curtis points and a Smolyak type multi-index set.
To this end, one uses `create_sparsegrid` with the desired Smolyak multi-index set.
In this case we choose a grid with dimension `n=3` and Smolyak level `w=3`.
```
using SparseGridsKit, Plots, LaTeXStrings
# Test create_sparsegrid
n,k =3,3
knots = [GaussHermitePoints(), CCPoints(), UniformPoints()]
rules = [Linear(), Doubling(), Doubling()]
mi_set = create_smolyak_miset(n,k)
sg = create_sparsegrid(mi_set, knots=knots, rule=rules)
nsteps = 100
@gif for i in range(0, stop = 2Ï€, length = nsteps)
        plot(sg)
        plot!(
                title="Sparse Grid n,k="*string(n)*","*string(k),
                xlabel=L"y_1",
                ylabel=L"y_2",
                zlabel=L"y_3",
                camera = (20 * (1 + cos(i)),10 * (1 + cos(i)))
                )
end
```
