# SparseGridsKit
A simple implementation of sparse grid polynomial interpolation and corresponding interpolation.

The construction is based upon the sparse operators introduced by Smolyak [Smolyak1963](@cite).
Key papers defining the model formulation include [Barthelmann2000](@cite), [Gerstner1998](@cite) and [Gerstner2003](@cite).
This construction of the approximation is inspired by the [Sparse Grids MATLAB Kit](https://sites.google.com/view/sparse-grids-kit) [Piazzola2024](@cite).

The package is still under development and by no means complete.
